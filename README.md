# Homework 0 - Basic Python

Write a python program that requests the user to input a number of cups. Then your script should distribute these cups to have the fewest number of _containers_. These containers have four different sizes: _gallon_, _quart_, _pint_, and _cup_ size. Here how they related to each other

```
1 pint = 2 cups
1 quart = 2 pint
1 gallon = 4 quart
```

Your code should therefore ask for a number of cups and print the result for each of the containers in the format `XX gallons, XX quarts, XX pints, XX cups` where `XX` are integer quantities.

## Example:

If the user has entered 9 as the number of cups. We would print:

`0 gallons, 2 quarts, 0 pints, 1 cup`

Please **note** that the `s` for the plural is removed when there is only 1 unit.

## Grading and Submission

1. The purpose of this homework is for **YOU** to determine whether you have sufficient prerequisites to take this class.
2. Regardless of the quality of your code, if you submit a solution for this exercise (i.e., a non-empty file) you will receive `100 points` for your first in-class activity.
3. To submit this homework, zip your source code (e.g., _main.py_) and submit this resulting file using the [homework submission system](https://homework.prototyping.id). Make sure the zip file is smaller than 20MB. Use _zip_ extensions, not _ALZIP_, _rar_, or other compressions.

## Please note that:

1. Only submissions made with the system will be considered (no direct emails to TA or Prof).
2. You can re-submit as many times as you want before the deadline &ndash; we will consider your last submission.
3. Submissions after the deadline are **NOT** accepted.
4. If the file is too large the system wonâ€™t allow the submission. Remove from the zip file unnecessary files, and make sure to compress your images.
5. Do not copy from the Internet or colleagues without attribution. Remember the _honor code policy_.
